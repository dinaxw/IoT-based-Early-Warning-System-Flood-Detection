The project "IoT-based Flood Detection Early Warning System" aims to detect the water level in the riverbed. The purpose is to check whether the water level is in normal condition or not. If it exceeds the specified limit, the system will give a warning through LED indication and through a message on Telegram app. This project uses ultrasonic sensors to detect the water level of the river and NodeMCU ESP8266 to process the data. The data will be uploaded to the ThingSpeak IoT cloud, with which the river water level can be graphically monitored from anywhere. The success of this project creates an innovative solution to provide real-time flood early warning.
There is also a 3D box design that will be used as a prototype container. The box was designed using SketchUp which effectively supports the concept of this project.
